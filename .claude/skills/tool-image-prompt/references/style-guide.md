# AEM Tools Image Style Guide

## Visual Style (Unified Direction)

**Core aesthetic: Abstract geometric compositions that evoke the tool's concept — more icon than illustration.**

- Abstract shapes, geometric forms, and stylized symbols as primary visual language
- Centered or radial compositions with a strong focal element
- Flat or semi-flat style with subtle depth (gradients, shadows, layering) — not fully 3D
- Bold color blocking with clean edges
- Dark or deep-toned backgrounds (navy, dark teal, deep slate) to make shapes pop
- No text or typography in the image
- Subject fills the frame with balanced negative space

### Abstraction Spectrum

The user chooses where each image falls on this spectrum:

1. **Mostly abstract** (preferred default) — pure shapes, color, and composition with only subtle hints of real objects. Example: Admin Edit (colorful diagonal ribbons with faint code texture)
2. **Stylized objects** — recognizable objects but heavily simplified and geometric. Example: Error Analyzer (stylized magnifying glass over abstract chart shapes)
3. **Grounded with abstract backdrop** — one recognizable anchor object against an abstract geometric background. Example: Sitemap Admin (code symbol centered in radiating node pattern)

## Color System

**Base palette (shared):** Rich, saturated colors against dark backgrounds. Deep teals/blues as anchors. Coral, orange, warm gold as accents. Clean gradients within shapes.

**Category color accents:**

| Category | Primary Accent | Secondary Accent | Background |
|---|---|---|---|
| Production Tools | Teal + Gold | Deep navy | Dark navy gradient |
| Content Tools | Coral + Teal | Warm pink | Deep teal gradient |
| Admin Tools | Blue-violet + Orange | Deep teal | Dark slate gradient |
| Development Tools | Electric blue + Coral | Dark slate | Deep navy gradient |

## Subject Matter
- **Evocative, not literal** — abstract shapes that suggest the tool's function
- Geometric forms: circles, radiating lines, layered planes, grids, node networks
- At most one recognizable "anchor" object (magnifying glass, gear, shield) — simplified to near-icon level
- Avoid detailed real-world scenes, workshops, rooms, or desks
- Avoid screens/monitors/UI mockups

| Tool | Description | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Admin Edit | Colorful diagonal ribbons/layers with faint code texture | Mostly abstract |
| Sitemap Admin | Code symbol in teal circle with radiating node lines on dark navy | Grounded + abstract |
| Error Analyzer | Stylized magnifying glass over abstract 3D bar charts and data shapes | Stylized objects |
| Page Status | Isometric geometric shapes with data visualization elements | Stylized objects |
| CDN Setup | Industrial pipes in a workshop setting | Real-world (legacy style) |

## Anti-Patterns
- Detailed real-world scenes (workshops, desks, rooms)
- Generic stock photo or photorealistic aesthetics
- Busy compositions with too many competing elements
- Text or typography in the image
- Dull or desaturated color palettes
- Overly literal depictions of software UI
